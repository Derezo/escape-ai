/**
 * Authoritative game engine — fixed-tick simulation loop.
 *
 * Game-agnostic: the only "gameplay" is that each player is a point that moves
 * according to its latest input. The genre-specific rules drop at hour 0; this
 * loop is the netcode skeleton they plug into.
 *
 * Each tick:
 *   1. advance currentTick
 *   2. integrate every player's latest input into its position
 *   3. broadcast `snapshot {tick, entities, acks, world}` to each room
 *
 * Entities are players merged with the room's static world props (pens, robots,
 * idle animals, terminals, the gate — owned by game/world.js). The WorldState
 * {panic, panicCapacity, lockdown} rides along on every snapshot; it's tiny.
 *
 * Delta vs. full broadcast:
 *   - Every FULL_REFRESH_INTERVAL ticks we send a *full* snapshot (every entity
 *     in the room) so late joiners and drifted clients resync.
 *   - On other ticks we send a *delta*: only entities whose serialized state
 *     changed since the last snapshot sent to that room. Static props don't
 *     change, so they only ride on full refreshes — which is what we want.
 *   Correctness over cleverness — the delta is a simple per-entity dirty check.
